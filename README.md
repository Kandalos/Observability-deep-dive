# Workbench – Real-World Engineering Notes

This repository is my personal collection of hands-on experiences, quick solutions, debugging adventures, configuration patterns, and small scripts/tools.

The goal is simple:  
→ Document things so I don't forget them  
→ Share practical knowledge that often isn't covered in official docs or blog posts  
→ Hopefully help someone else save a few hours (or nights) of debugging

Feel free to browse, copy, adapt — and open issues/PRs if you spot improvements or want to add your own war stories.
